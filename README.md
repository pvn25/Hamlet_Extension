Hamlet Extension - Avoiding Joins for High Capacity Classifiers

This repository contains:
(1) Implementation in R when avoiding joins for Decision Trees, RBF-SVM, 1 Nearest Neighbor classifiers and Neural Networks. 
(2) Codes for Monte Carlo based simulations to study the effects of different propoerties of data distribution on ML accuracy. 
(3) Codes for proposed foreign Key domain compression techniques and foreign key smoothing techniques.
